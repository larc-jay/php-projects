<span class="heading-blue-3">CANCELLATION AND REFUND</span><br /><br />
 
You can always cancel a training in writing. We will not charge you for the training if you cancel it one month before the first training day. We will charge you 50% of the training price if you cancel the training within a span of 30 days to 2 weeks before the first training day. If you cancel a training within 2 weeks of the first training day, we will charge you the full training price. We may interrupt, reschedule, and/or cancel a training in case of unforeseen circumstances, including without limitation a shortage or excess of applications for a specific training, or illness of the trainer. We will always notify you of this as soon as possible. After you have received such notification, you will have 2 weeks to cancel the training and receive a full refund. DigiInsight cannot be held responsible for any financial loss incurred by the client or its employer due to rescheduling or cancellation of any course. A course participant will not receive a refund for non-attendance in a scheduled course. In the case of an act of God, natural disaster or hospitalization that prevents the client from attending, a request can be made in writing to info@digiinsight.com for consideration of a refund. Documentation may be required to support your claim for a refund.
